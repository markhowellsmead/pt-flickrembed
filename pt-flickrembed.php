Caching
=======
Image data is cached on the local web server in order to improve performance.
UPDATEMODE "W" means that the data will be cached weekly. XML files are stored
in a subfolder "pt-flickrembed" of the standard upload directory specified
in the default WordPress Admin tool (Settings Â» Media).

In the absence of an options page in the current version, you'll need to add
the Flickr API key and secret manually. Get these from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/

Attributes LINK, TITLE, ALIGN and SIZE are optional. ID is required.

If LINK is empty, the image will be linked to the Flickr page for the photo.

Usual ALIGN values: right, left. (If no alignment left/right is required, leave blank)

If SIZE is empty, the 500px version will be displayed.
Refer to http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html for valid sizes.
